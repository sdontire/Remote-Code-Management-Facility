ACADEMIC PROJECTS:
SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY TOUR: 
•	Designed a website tour of Syracuse University. Used Google Maps that shows the viewer’s current location relative to Quad center.
•	 File upload and deletion facilities through a Web API that is hosted on the site server and communicates with remote desktop clients, also developed as part of this project. This service requires authentication as a member of an administrator role, defined by the site. 
•	Server side software built with ASP.Net MVC and ASP.NET WebApi. Used SQL Server to manage User login information and Tour images and description.
CODE ANALYSER:
•	Developed a program for analysis of C# code. The analyzer, given a set of file references, finds all the types, their members, and relationships with other types. 
•	Further, the analyzer constructs two metrics for each member function: its size in lines of code, and complexity defined as the number of elements in its scope tree.
•	 The purpose of this code analysis is to find functions that may need attention because of their size and/or complexity. A secondary purpose is to help developers get a quick understanding of the structure of a set of code.

LEADERSHIP
•	Class representative of 80 students for four years in Engineering college
•	Computer Science department representative of 140 students in college-level events.
•	Team leader for undergraduate final project.

ACHIEVEMENTS
•	Member of winning team of “SPARK 2015” competition organized by O’Brien and Gere.
•	Team Leader of the team which designed 3 games and hacking presentation in Dr. Nelson Ying Tri Region Science and Engineering Fair.
